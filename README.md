# ProofOfHeart

**A decentralized launchpad where the community — not a corporation — validates a cause.**

ProofOfHeart empowers everyday people to rally behind the causes they believe in. By leveraging blockchain transparency and community-driven governance, it removes gatekeepers from the fundraising process and puts trust back where it belongs: in the hands of the people.

## 🌟 Vision & Mission

- **Vision**: A world where any meaningful cause can receive support without needing permission from a centralized authority.
- **Mission**: To build an open, transparent launchpad that lets communities discover, validate, and fund causes through decentralized consensus — ensuring that every voice counts and every contribution is accounted for on-chain.

## 🚀 Core Principles

-   **Community First**: Causes are validated by the people, not by a corporate board.
-   **Radical Transparency**: Every decision and transaction lives on-chain for anyone to verify.
-   **Permissionless Participation**: Anyone can propose, support, or challenge a cause.
-   **Trust Through Code**: Smart contracts enforce the rules, removing the need for intermediaries.
